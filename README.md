In our project we have implemented total five(5) functions

The implemented functions are listed below

In the function Get Parent() , the user has to pass the argument (child_element) in order to get the desired output.

In the function Get Next() , user has to pass the index position and then this function will return the next value from that index position.

In the function Update Value() , user has to pass the value that he or she wants to be updated and also user has to tell the index position at which he or she wants to update the value.

In the function Get Prefix Sum() , user has to pass the index position and the function will return the sum of all the preceding values including the value of the current index position input by the user.

In the fucntion Get Sum Of Range() , user has to define the staring and ending index and then the function will return the sum of the value that lies between this range.
